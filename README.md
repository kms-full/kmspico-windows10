## How to Download, Install, and Set Up KMSPico Windows 10 [Tested]


# How to Download, Install, and Set Up KMS Pico Windows 10

KMSPico Windows 10 is a popular and safe activation tool that can activate Windows 10 (all editions) as well as Microsoft Office products without a license key. It emulates a local Key Management Service (KMS) server, essentially tricking Windows into believing that it’s been activated legitimately. The utility was designed to offer large-scale business licensing to enterprises but today, it’s become the go-to choice for users seeking a free Windows 10 activator. In our guide, we’re going to break down how to download it, install it, and set it up while staying safe. Let’s get started!

# Where to Download KMS Pico for Windows 10 Safely

The utility is unofficial so you must stick to well-known, reputable sources for KMS Activator Windows 10. Many sites allow you to download this utility while bundling it with malware of some kind. That can be disastrous for your PC. Here’s how to download it safely:
At the time of writing, there are a couple of 100% working and safe sources you can download from:

    1. This is the official GitHub page maintained by Team Daz, the original creator of this tool. They have a GPU General Public License under the name of Free Software Foundation, Inc. The older repository is not available anymore and this GitHub page only has the license as of right now.
    2. Team Daz has its own website where you can download 100% clean and “official” KMSPico for your Windows 10 system.
    3. A website maintained by some contributors who claim to scan their utilities with Virus Total before uploading. They have several other activation tools as well and a good reputation. 100% safe and tested as of 2024.
    
Only stick to one of the above sources. Do not Google KMSPico and arrive on any random website to download this utility. If none of the sources above work, only then you should look at anything else.

# Follow these steps to safely download KMSPico Windows 10 installer.

    1. Disable your antivirus. This is a temporary measure. Some antiviruses allow you to disable them entirely, others might be more complex. The majority of Windows 10 users only have the default Windows Defender, so let’s see how to disable it. Open Defender (now called Windows Security) and go to its various sections.
        a. Virus & threat protection > Manage settings (under Virus & threat protection settings) > Turn off Real-time protection and Cloud-delivered protection.
        b. App & browser control > Reputation-based protection settings > Turn off the toggle for Potentially unwanted app blocking.
    2. Next, as an added precaution, exclude a folder from your antivirus settings. This folder will not be scanned by the antivirus program. For example, open Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > scroll down to Exclusions > Add or remove exclusions > Add an exclusion > Select a folder here. If your browser downloads everything to the Downloads folder by default, you might want to exclude this folder directly.
    3. Now, download the KMSPico executable/portable file on your device from one of the three sources we mentioned in the previous section. You might need to extract the zip file.
That’s it! Now, it’s time to install the tool and activate your Windows 10 installation.

# How to Install KMS Pico on Windows 10 Step-by-Step

Let’s see how to install the Windows 10 KMSPico utility.

    1. Open the executable file.
    2. Follow the on-screen instructions such as disabling the internet and choosing the directory (this directory is also preferred to be excluded from the antivirus scans).
    3. Finish the installation.
    
The process is just like installing any other program on your Windows 10 PC. Once the installation is automatically finished, your Windows will be activated (Office too, if you did that instead).

# Setting Up KMSPico on Windows 10

Once you have downloaded and installed KMSPico on your system safely, your Windows will be activated. We recommend restarting the PC once, though it’s not compulsory. Go to your Settings > System > About (or you can right-click on This PC and select Properties). Here, you will be able to see the product ID, which means that Windows is activated. Also, if you had the “Activate Windows” watermark in the bottom right, it would disappear instantly.
Although KMS only offers a 180-day activation, this tool is pretty advanced and can run every 180 days to renew the license key automatically without your supervision. Still, you might need to reinstall it once every six months. In this case, uninstall the older KMSPico installation first.
Some updates might remove KMSPico. Sadly, there is no way around this. You’ll need to reinstall it again.
